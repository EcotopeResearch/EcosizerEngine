        Converts from hours of heating in a day to heating capacity. Takes maximum from

        ----------
        heathours : float or numpy.ndarray
            The number of hours primary heating equipment can run.
        loadUpHours : float
            Number of scheduled load up hours before first shed period.

            The building the system being sized for
