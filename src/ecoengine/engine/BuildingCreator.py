    Attributes
    ----------
    incomingT_F : float 
        The incoming city water temperature on the design day. [째F]
    magnitudeStat : int or list
        a number that will be used to assess the magnitude of the building based on the building type
    supplyT_F : float
        The hot water supply temperature.[째F]
    buildingType : string or list
        a string indicating the type of building we are sizing for (e.g. "multi_family", "office_building", etc.)
    loadShape : ndarray
        defaults to design load shape for building type.
    avgLoadShape : ndarray
        defaults to average load shape for building type.
    returnT_F : float 
        The water temperature returning from the recirculation loop. [째F]
    flowRate : float 
        The pump flow rate of the recirculation loop. (GPM)
    gpdpp : float
        The volume of water in gallons at 120F each person uses per dat.[째F]
    nBR : array_like
        A list of the number of units by size in the order 0 bedroom units,
        1 bedroom units, 2 bedroom units, 3 bedroom units, 4 bedroom units,
        5 bedroom units.
    nApt: integer
        The number of apartments. Use with Qdot_apt to determine total recirculation losses. (For multi-falmily buildings)
    Wapt:  float
        Watts of heat lost in through recirculation piping system. Used with N_apt to determine total recirculation losses. (For multi-falmily buildings)
    standardGPD : string
        indicates whether to use a standard gpdpp specification for multi-family buildings. Set to None if not using a standard gpdpp.
    annual : boolean
        indicates whether to use annual loadshape for multi-family buildings
    zipCode : int
        the CA zipcode the building resides in to determine the climate zone
    climateZone : int
        the CA climate zone the building resides in
    ignoreRecirc : boolean
        Set to true if recirc_losses is irrelevent due to no temperature maintenance system

    Raises
    ----------
    Exception: Error if buildingType is not in list of valid buildingType names.
